# Abstract
This workshop will explore the state-of-the-art applications of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) in general anesthesia monitoring. BCIs offer the potential to improve patient care by providing direct neural feedback, giving clinicians real-time insights into brain activity during anesthesia through EEG-based tools to monitor awareness and the depth of anesthesia. We will focus on integrating BCIs in clinical settings, emphasizing how they can enhance anesthesia precision and enable more individualized care. Following brief introductions and discussions of relevant research methodologies and empirical findings (i.e., neural markers of awareness, machine learning tools, experimental protocols to study depth of anesthesia, etc.), we aim to open a dialogue on the implications of BCIs in the operating room and their potential to transform general anesthesia practice. In particular, better monitoring through BCIs could significantly reduce the incidence of intraoperative awareness, a rare but serious complication where patients regain consciousness during surgery. Participants will gain an understanding of the technical challenges, ethical considerations, and potential clinical benefits of employing BCIs for anesthesia monitoring. The workshop will provide a platform for cross-disciplinary discussion, inviting contributions from experts in neurotechnology, anesthesiology, and clinical practice to advance the state of knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.

# Learning objectives
In this workshop, we will explore a range of key topics aimed at advancing the use of BCIs in anesthesia monitoring. Among these, we will discuss promising algorithms for BCI applications, technical challenges related to EEG recording in the operating room, and the critical metrics BCIs should measure—whether awareness, amnesia, or consciousness. Ethical considerations for data collection, as well as the sensitivity, selectivity, and precision required for a successful BCI, will also be covered. We will tackle practical questions such as identifying suitable 'ground truth data' and testing BCI methods in clinical settings. Based on these topics, participants will achieve the following learning objectives:
- Participants will be able to learn about 3 existing research projects exploring the use of BCI for anesthesia monitoring;
- Participants will be able to identify at least three key technical challenges related to integrating BCIs for anesthesia monitoring in clinical settings;
- Participants will be able to discuss ethical considerations and propose solutions for data collection and patient safety in the context of BCI monitoring during surgery;
- Participants will be able to outline a roadmap for the clinical integration of BCI technology in anesthesia, identifying critical steps and potential barriers.

# Intended audience
This workshop is designed for researchers, clinicians, and engineers working in the fields of neurotechnology, anesthesia, and/or brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Participants should have a basic understanding of neuroscience or BCI technology. The workshop will be particularly relevant for those interested in the clinical application of BCI for monitoring brain activity during general anesthesia. Attendees will gain insights into how BCIs can improve patient safety and outcomes, especially in reducing the occurrence of intraoperative awareness. Prior experience with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or anesthesiology is recommended but not required.

# Interactive component
This workshop will include several interactive components designed to engage participants actively. After initial presentations of relevant research by several speakers, attendees will be divided into small breakout groups to discuss the potential clinical applications of BCIs in anesthesia. Each group will work on identifying key challenges and potential solutions for integrating BCI monitoring into existing anesthesia protocols. These discussions will be followed by group presentations to share findings and stimulate broader dialogue.

# Expected outputs
The expected outputs from this workshop include the formulation of a roadmap for the clinical integration of BCI technologies in general anesthesia. Participants will collaboratively identify critical challenges and propose strategies to address them, which should hopefully lead to the publication of a review paper summarizing the workshop's findings and discussions. Additionally, the workshop will aim to generate interest in developing open-source tools and guidelines for real-time BCI monitoring during anesthesia. These contributions will serve as a foundation for future research and clinical trials, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration between neurotechnology experts and anesthesiologists.
